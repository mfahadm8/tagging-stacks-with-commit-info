# Tagging AWS Stacks with Git Commit Information
This project demonstrates the implementation of tagging CloudFormation stacks with Git commit information for enhanced accountability, traceability, and documentation in DevOps workflows. It also discusses the future implementation of this practice using AWS CDK pipelines.

For a detailed understanding of benefits and implementation steps, please refer to my accompanying blog post [here](https://medium.com/@mfahadm8/tagging-cloudformation-stacks-with-git-information-501b441f2411).
